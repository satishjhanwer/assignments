# Question 1

In Array-land, the King has decided that the Array, which has grown too large, must be reduced to no more than half its original size. The Array can have repeated elements. Sir Algor, the Royal Mathematician, has been tasked with this challenge. Can you determine the minimum number of distinct elements Sir Algor needs to remove to ensure the Array's size becomes less than or equal to half of its original size.

Allowed Time Complexity: *O(n log(n))*

*Input Format:* The first line of the input contains the number of elements in the array. And
the second line provides the elements of the array (separated by space).

*Output Format:* Just print a single value representing the minimum number of distinct elements.

*Sample Input:*

```bash
5
1 2 4 1 1
```

*Sample Output:*

```bash
1
```
