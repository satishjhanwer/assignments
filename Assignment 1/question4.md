# Question 4

Given a positive integer `N`, generate all the binary numbers between `1 and N`, where `1` and `N` are also included.
  
Allowed Time Complexity is *O(n log(n))*.

*Input Format:* The first line of input contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first and only line contains a positive integer `N`, which represents the positive integer.

*Output Format:* For each test case print `N` space separated binary numbers from `1 to N` in a separate line. The output of each test case is in a separate line.

*Sample Input:*

```bash
3

1
2
4
```

*Sample Output:*

```bash
1
1 10
1 10 11 100
```
